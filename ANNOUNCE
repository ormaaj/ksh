Announcing: KornShell 93u+m/1.0.6
https://github.com/ksh93/ksh

Sooner than expected after the fifth, here is the sixth ksh 93u+m/1.0 bugfix
release. 93u+m/1.0.5 brought a wide range of bugfixes and robustness
enhancements, but also introduced a serious regression in pathname
expansion, so that previous release is WITHDRAWN and should not be used.

Further below is an overview of the main changes. For greater detail, see
the NEWS file in the distribution. For complete detail, see the git(1)
commit log, which has full documentation of every significant change.

### HOW TO GET IT ###

Please download the source code tarball from our GitHub releases page:
https://github.com/ksh93/ksh/releases
To build, follow the instructions in README.md or src/cmd/ksh93/README.

Or ask your distribution package manager to upgrade ksh to this version.

### ABOUT KSH ###

KornShell (ksh) is a full-featured and very fast shell script interpreter
and interactive command shell with a distinguished lineage: it is a direct
descendant of the Bourne shell and, like its ancestor, was developed at
AT&T, the birthplace of UNIX. ksh has been open source since 2000.

But when AT&T terminated development in 2020, ksh was left buggy and
unreliable. ksh 93u+m aims to fix this situation whilst maintaining and
growing the tradition. For now, we are focusing mostly on fixing bugs and
egregious flaws but we also prioritise backward compatibility, performance,
portability, and occasionally adding a feature. Work on ksh 93u+m started in
May 2020, based on the last AT&T stable release, ksh 93u+.

Unique ksh features include discipline functions (every variable expansion
or assignment can trigger a shell function call determining its value),
static scoping of local variables in functions, the ability to define your
own data types, customisable tilde expansion (new in 93u+m), a shell option
for file system case (in)sensitivity detection for pathname expansion and
file name completion (new in 93u+m), and much more.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.5 and 93u+m/1.0.6 ###

- Fixed a serious regression in pathname expansion where quoted wildcard
  characters were incorrectly expanded if a pattern contains both a brace
  expansion and a variable expansion.
- Fixed a bug where the command to launch a full-screen editor (^X^E in
  emacs and 'v' in vi) could cause the wrong command line to be edited
  if two shell sessions share a .sh_history file.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.4 and 93u+m/1.0.5 ###

- Fixed various bugs causing crashes.
- Fixed many bugs in the emacs and vi line editors, in command completion,
  and in file name completion.
- Fixed various bugs in the handling of quotes, backslash escapes and braces
  when processing shell glob patterns (e.g. in pathname expansion and 'case').
- ksh now throws a panic and exits if a read error (such as an I/O error)
  occurs while trying to read the next command(s) from a running script.
- Fixed many bugs in 'printf' and 'print -f' built-in commands, including:
  . Multiple bugs causing incorrect output for relative date specifications,
    e.g., printf %T\\n 'exactly 20 months ago' now outputs a correct result.
  . More printf bugs with mix and match of % and %x$.
  . A data corruption bug when using %B with 'printf -v varname'.
  . A bug causing double evaluation of arithmetic expressions.
- Fixed a bug where 'unset -f commandname', executed in a subshell, hides
  any built-in command by the same name for the duration of that subshell.
- Fixed ${var/#/string} and ${var/%/string} (with anchored empty pattern)
  to work as on mksh, bash and zsh; these are no longer ineffective.
- Fixed incorrect result of array slicing ${array[@]:offset:length} where
  'length' is a nested expansion involving an array.
- Command names can now end in ':' as they can on other shells.
- Fixed a spurious syntax error in compound assignments upon encountering a
  pair of repeated opening parentheses '(('.
- Fixed spurious syntax error in ${parameter:offset:length}: the arithmetic
  expressions 'offset' and 'length' may now contain the operators ( ) & |.
- Fixed a parsing bug in the declaration of .sh.math.* arithmetic functions.
- Fixed nameref self-reference loop detection for more than two namerefs.
- Several improvements to the POSIX compatibility mode.
- Many more minor and/or esoteric bugfixes.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.3 and 93u+m/1.0.4 ###

- Fixed multiple scoping-related bugs in the += additive assignment operator.
- A number of crashing bugs have been fixed.
- Various fixes for the Haiku operating system, notably 'ulimit -a' now works.
- Fixed the expansion of out-of-range \n back references in the string part of
  ${parameter//pattern/string}. For example:  v=AB; echo "${v/@(A)B/\0:\1:\2}"
  now yields 'AB:A:' instead of 'AB:A:\2'.
- Fixed quoted '!', '^' and '-' within [bracket] expressions in glob patterns;
  single or double quotes failed to disable their operator behaviour.
- Fixed a bug introduced on 2021-04-04 that incorrectly allowed 'typeset' to
  turn off the readonly and export attributes on a readonly variable.
- In the emacs line editor, the Ctrl+R reverse-search prompt is now visually
  distinct from a literal control character ("^R: " instead of "^R").
- In the vi line editor, fixed the behaviour of 'C', 'c$' and 'I' to be
  consistent with standard vi(1) and with Bolsky & Korn (1995, p. 121).
- Aliases for many GNU long options have been added to the /opt/ast/bin
  built-in commands. Additionally, 'kill -s' now has a --signal long option
  alias compatible with the util-linux option.
- Backported support for 'print -u p' from ksh 93v- for compatibility with
  scripts written for 93v-/ksh2020 (this is equivalent to 'print -p').

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.2 and 93u+m/1.0.3 ###

This point release fixes the following:
- An old bug in history expansion (set -H) where any use of the history
  comment character caused processing to be aborted as if it were an invalid
  history expansion.
- A bug in command line options processing that caused short-form
  option equivalents on some built-in commands to be ignored after one use,
  e.g., the new read -a equivalent of read -A.
- Ksh freezing or using excessive memory if HISTSIZE is assigned a
  pathologically large value.
- A bug that caused ksh in the vi editor mode to crash or produce invalid
  completions if ESC = was used at the beginning of a line.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.1 and 93u+m/1.0.2 ###

This bugfix release fixes the interactive shell crashing when one of the
predefined aliases (currently 'history' and 'r') is redefined, whether from
a profile/kshrc script or manually. This crash occurred in two scenarios:
1. when redefining and then unsetting a predefined alias;
2. when redefining a predefined alias and then executing a shell script that
   does not begin with a #! path.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+m/1.0.0 and 93u+m/1.0.1 ###

This is an urgent bugfix release that removes an incorrect exec
optimization that was capable of terminating the execution of scripts
prematurely in certain corner cases. It is known to make the build scripts
of GNU binutils produce corrupted results if ksh is used as /bin/sh.
See https://github.com/ksh93/ksh/issues/507 for more information.

### MAIN CHANGES between ksh 93u+ and 93u+m/1.0.0 ###

Roughly a thousand bugs have been fixed, including many serious/critical
bugs. See the NEWS file for more information, and the git commit log for
complete documentation of every fix. Incompatible changes have been
minimised, but not at the expense of fixing bugs. For a list of
potentially incompatible changes, see src/cmd/ksh93/COMPATIBILITY.

Though there was a "no new features, bugfixes only" policy, some new
features were found necessary, either to fix serious design flaws or to
complete functionality that was evidently intended, but not finished.
Below is a summary of these new features.

New command line editor features:

- The forward-delete and End keys are now handled as expected in the
  emacs and vi built-in line editors.

- In the vi and emacs line editors, repeat counts can now also be used for
  arrow keys and the forward-delete key, e.g., <ESC> 7 <left-arrow> works.

- Various keys on extended PC keyboards are now handled as expected in the
  emacs and vi built-in line editors.

New shell language features:

- Pathname expansion (a.k.a. globbing) now never matches the special names
  '.' (current directory) and '..' (parent directory). This change makes a
  pattern like .* useful; it now matches all hidden files (dotfiles) in the
  current directory, without the harmful inclusion of '.' and '..'.

- Tilde expansion can now be extended or modified by defining a .sh.tilde.get
  or .sh.tilde.set discipline function. See the manual for details.

- The &>file redirection shorthand (for >file 2>&1) is now available for all
  scripts and interactive sessions and not only for profile/login scripts.

- Arithmetic expressions in native ksh mode no longer interpret a number
  with a leading zero as octal in any context. Use 8#octalnumber instead
  (e.g. 8#400 == 256). Arithmetic expressions now also behave identically
  within and outside ((...)) and $((...)). If the POSIX mode is turned on,
  a leading zero now denotes an octal number in all arithmetic contexts.

New features in built-in commands:

- Usage error messages now show the --help/--man self-documentation options.

- Path-bound built-ins (such as /opt/ast/bin/cat) can now be executed by
  invoking the canonical path, so the following will now work as expected:
	$ /opt/ast/bin/cat --version
	  version         cat (AT&T Research) 2012-05-31

- 'cd' now supports an -e option that, when combined with -P, verifies
  that $PWD is correct after changing directories; this helps detect
  access permission problems. See:
  https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=253

- 'command -x' now looks for external commands only, skipping built-ins.
  In addition, its xargs-like functionality no longer freezes the shell on
  Linux and macOS, making it effectively a new feature on these systems.

- 'printf' now supports a -v option as in bash. This assigns formatted
  output directly to variables, which is very fast and will not strip
  final newline (\n) characters.

- 'redirect' now checks if all arguments are valid redirections before
  performing them. If an error occurs, it issues an error message instead
  of terminating the shell.

- 'return', when used to return from a function, can now return any
  status value in the 32-bit signed integer range, like on zsh. However,
  due to a traditional Unix kernel limitation, $? is still trimmed to its
  least significant 8 bits whenever a shell or subshell exits.

- 'suspend' now refuses to suspend a login shell, as there is probably no
  parent shell to return to and the login session would freeze.

- 'test'/'[' now supports all the same operators as [[ (including =~,
  \<, \>) except for the different 'and'/'or' operators. Note that
  'test'/'[' remains deprecated due to its unfixable pitfalls;
  [[ ... ]] is recommended instead.

- 'times' now gives high precision output in a POSIX compliant format.

- 'type'/'whence': Two bash-like flags were backported from ksh 93v-:
  - 'whence -P/type -P' is an alias to the existing -p flag.
  - 'whence -t/type -t' will print only the type of a command in a
    simple format that is designed to be easy to use for scripts.

- 'typeset' has a new '-g' flag that forces variables to be created or
  modified at the global scope regardless of context, as on bash 4.2+.

- 'typeset' now gives an informative error message if an incompatible
  combination of options is given.

- 'ulimit': Added three options inspired by bash:
  - 'ulimit -k' sets the maximum number of kqueues.
  - 'ulimit -P' sets the maximum number of pseudo-terminals.
  - 'ulimit -R' sets the maximum time in microseconds a real-time process
    can run before blocking.
  Note that not all operating systems support the limits set by these options.

- 'whence -v/-a' now reports the location of autoloadable functions.

New features in shell options:

- When the -b/--notify shell option is on and the vi or emacs/gmacs shell
  line editor is in use, 'Done' and similar notifications from completed
  background jobs are now inserted directly above the line you're typing,
  without affecting your command line display.

- A new --functrace long-form shell option causes the -x/--xtrace option's
  state and the DEBUG trap action to be inherited by function scopes instead
  of being reset to default. Changes made to them within a function scope
  still do not propagate back to the parent scope. Similarly, this option
  also causes the DEBUG trap action to be inherited by subshells.

- A new --globcasedetect shell option is added on operating systems where
  we can check for a case-insensitive file system (currently Linux, macOS,
  QNX 7.0+, and Windows/Cygwin). When this option is turned on, pathname
  expansion (globbing), as well as tab completion on interactive shells,
  automatically become case-insensitive depending on the file system.
  This is separately determined for each pathname component.

- Enhancement to -G/--globstar: symbolic links to directories are now
  followed if they match a normal (non-**) glob pattern. For example, if
  '/lnk' is a symlink to a directory, '/lnk/**' and '/l?k/**' now work as
  you would expect.

- The new --histreedit and --histverify options modify history expansion
  (--histexpand). If --histreedit is on and a history expansion fails, the
  command line is reloaded into the next prompt's edit buffer, allowing
  corrections. If --histverify is on, the results of a history expansion are
  not immediately executed but instead loaded into the next prompt's edit
  buffer, allowing further changes.

- A new --nobackslashctrl shell option disables the special escaping
  behaviour of the backslash character in the emacs and vi built-in editors.
  Particularly in the emacs editor, this makes it much easier to go back,
  insert a forgotten backslash into a command, and then continue editing
  without having your next arrow key replace your backslash with garbage.

- A new --posix shell option has been added to ksh 93u+m that makes the
  ksh language more compatible with other shells by following the POSIX
  standard more closely. See the manual page for details. It is enabled by
  default if ksh is invoked as sh, otherwise it is disabled by default.
